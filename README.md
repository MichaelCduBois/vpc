VPC or Virtual Private Chat will be a Facebook Messenger alternative.

## Project Goals

1. Self hosted node server sending messages via websocket connections.
2. Mobile device applications that connect to self hosted servers.

## Reason for this Project

I want a way to talk with my family and friends, off of the 3rd party platforms, to limit the potential breach of privacy rights.
